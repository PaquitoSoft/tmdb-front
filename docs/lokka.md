##Â Notes
* Includes 'credentials' by default in all queries/mutations
* Automatically includes a prefix into mutation definitions so you don't have to. It's mandatory you don't include this or it breaks (https://github.com/kadirahq/lokka#mutations). This should be optional so you don't have to change your mutations if you're migrating. Besides, you can't use named mutations for better debugging in server.
